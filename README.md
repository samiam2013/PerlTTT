# PerlTTT
A Perl API and vanilla JS/HTML Tic-Tac-Toe implementation.

User plays X symbol, minimax agent plays O on a simple 9-button grid. Moves automatically trigger response moves.

Created using CentOS and Apache with CGI-bin, mostly so that I can aquaint myself with and prove that I can work with Perl, as most of my background is in PHP and Go.
