# PerlTTT
A Perl API and vanilla JS/HTML Tic-Tac-Toe implementation.

User plays X symbol, minimax agent plays O on a simple 9-button grid. Moves automatically trigger response moves.

Created using CentOS and Apache with CGI-bin, mostly so that I can aquaint myself with Perl, as most of my work has been in PHP, C# and Go.

# Installation
Helpful instructions for Apache CGI-bin use on Centos can be found here: https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_7&p=httpd&f=2 From there, directories can be pointed at the cgi-bin and html folders in this repo on your system or you can move the files in the folders manually (there are only 2)
